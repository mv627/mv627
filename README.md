### Hi everyone!

<!-->
My name is Nasha and I'm pursuing my PhD at the Bloustein School of Policy and Urban Planning at Rutgers. I study the impact of platform consumer technologies on urban gentrification and economic systems. I focus on New York City (where I live!) I'm a bit of a noob but particularly interested in geospatial analyses and presenting these beautifully. 

Do send me an [email](mailto:mv627@rutgers.edu?subject=[GitHub]%20Source%20Han%20Sans) if you have any questions or would like to work on any projects together!
